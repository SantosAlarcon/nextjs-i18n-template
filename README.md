This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) template that uses the `i18next` library to load the translations. To avoid hydration errors, it uses the `i18next-http-backend` to load the translations on the servers.

The available languages loaded are: **english**, **spanish** and **catalian**.

## ⚠️⚠️ WARNING!!! ⚠️⚠️

This template is based on the **NextJS 15 RC** and works with the RC versions of **React 19** and **React DOM**.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
